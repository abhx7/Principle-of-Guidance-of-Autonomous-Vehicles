This project focuses on developing a multiphase guidance algorithm for UAVs in a nonlinear engagement framework. Together, we addressed challenges like:  
- Controlling approach angles for a UAV to engage a stationary target from any direction, while considering the restrictions imposed by the seekerâ€™s field of view (FOV). This was achieved by improving upon the standard and two-phase Pure Proportional Navigation (PPN) methods.  
- Optimizing trajectory costs using \(\int a_p^2 dt\) for the 2pPPN orientation phase.  
- Analyzing the post-orientation phase for \(N > 2\) and determining the optimum \(N\).  
- Conducting simulations, testing, and validating our methods.  
- Preparing and refining presentations to summarize and share our work.  

All aspects of the project were equally shared and collaboratively completed.
